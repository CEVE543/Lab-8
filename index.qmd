## Objectives

1. Apply k-means clustering to sea level pressure fields
1. Identify and interpret weather regimes
1. Connect weather types to precipitation or temperature extremes
1. Understand appropriate use cases and limitations

## Before

## Background and Reading

<!-- Content will be added here -->

## Tasks

Modify the code section below to address the following tasks.

1. Apply k-means clustering to daily sea level pressure fields
1. Identify distinct weather regimes and visualize their spatial patterns
1. Analyze the relationship between weather types and local precipitation/temperature
1. Evaluate clustering quality and interpret physical meaning of weather states

## Code

```{julia}
#| output: false
using Pkg
lab_dir = dirname(@__FILE__)
Pkg.activate(lab_dir)
# Pkg.instantiate() # uncomment this the first time you run the lab to install packages, then comment it back
```
